## Hi there I'm Will 👋
Hey, my name's Will, or DamascusSmith on most platforms I use. I'm currently a student learning programming with a passion for learning, and what goes into how we learn.

My first language was **C#** when I first started seriously messing with unity when I was 17ish, since then though my favorite languages to program in have become **Java, C++, and Frontend** in general.
I primarily have enjoyed **C++** for the low level grasp you get of how things work.
As of late I've also started to feel I have a good grasp of **SQL** Queries and have enjoyed whenever they pop-up.

📫 How to reach me: **Wickendenwilliam@gmail.com**, or **@sirshrkimpalot on Discord**
